However, it does not have enriched contacts with emails and only one decision-maker with a high decision_power is required, but multiple are found. The total score would be 0.5 + 0.2 + 0.2 = 0.9. However, since there are no enriched contacts, we cannot add the +0.1 for enriched contacts with emails, but we can add +0.1 for multiple decision-makers. The total score becomes 0.5 + 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.1 = 1.0. Since the final confidence score is > 0.7, it seems the lead should be verified. But upon closer inspection, the rejection rule of 'No roles with decision_power >= 7' is technically not applicable because there are roles with decision_power >= 7, however 'Has enriched contacts with emails' is a crucial aspect for verification and the enriched contacts list is empty, meaning we should lean towards rejection. Moreover, multiple decision-makers with high decision power were found which is a positive signal but not enough given the lack of contact information.",
