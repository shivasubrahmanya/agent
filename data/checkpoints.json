However, this score is reduced due to the lack of enriched contacts with emails, resulting in a score of 0.9. Despite this, the final confidence score is still above the required threshold, but since there are actually no enriched contacts, we must also consider the effect of having no contacts which significantly affects our confidence in this lead. Thus, considering all factors including the lack of contact information, the final confidence score is adjusted downwards to reflect the uncertainty.",
