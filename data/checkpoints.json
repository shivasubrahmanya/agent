Yet, considering the absence of enriched contacts and multiple decision-makers, the score remains at 0.9. Since the confidence score equals 0.9 and then no other increment can be added, the confidence score then is adjusted to 0.7 for lead rejection, considering it is below the required threshold for a verified status but the lead still shows potential and should be reviewed again in the future.",
